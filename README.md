# HEARTS ATTACK!

This project is a web app implementation of the classic card game Hearts.

## Introduction

We are designing an online version of the card game ‚ÄúHearts‚Äù, in which players
can meet online for a match or complete their group with virtual players. Our
aim is to provide players with detailed statistics of previous wins/losses so
they can track their progress and compare their skills with other players.

## High-Level Components

### 1. **MatchPage Component**

- **File:** [`/app/match/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/match/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Handles the main game view, including card rendering, trick
  management, score display, and player interactions.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch and update game state.

### 2. **StartPage Component**

- **File:** [`/app/start/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/start/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Handles the match setup and invites players. This page allows the
  host to configure the match by selecting players, setting game rules (e.g.,
  point limits), and inviting players (either humans or AI).
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to to manage player
  invitations, configure match settings, and retrieve the match state (e.g.,
  invites, current players). It may also handle AI configuration.

### 3. **Profile Component**

- **Role:** Displays and allows the user to edit their profile information such
  as username, avatar, and personal statistics (e.g., games played, win rate).
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch the user's profile
  data and allows for updates.

### 4. **Leaderboard Component**

- **File:** [`/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`](./app/leaderboard/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Displays the leaderboard showing scores and rankings of players in
  the game. It keeps track of each player's progress across different matches.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch player statistics and
  scores and updates the leaderboard accordingly.

### 5. **Friends Component**

- **File:** [`/app/friends/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/friends/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Manages the user's friends list, including sending and receiving
  friend requests, viewing accepted friends, and handling pending or declined
  requests.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to send and receive friend
  requests, display a list of accepted friends, and update the friends list
  based on user actions.
